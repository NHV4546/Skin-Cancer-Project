# Skin-Cancer-Project
Educational project on skin lesion classification (including melanoma) using machine learning. Built on the open HAM10000 dataset, this project aims to develop a model that can automatically distinguish between dangerous and benign skin lesions from images. It is created as a trial project and a starting point for exploring AI in healthcare.
